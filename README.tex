This is a binary search tree implemented in C by Group 8 in the Spring 2019 section of CSCI 205 at the University of Montana. It supports reading space separated integers from a file specified at runtime through a command line argument. A full list and description of the available functions can be found in the "Function Documentation" section below. In addition to the functions supplied within the source code, the repository includes a makefile, and a bash script for testing the functionality of the program.
